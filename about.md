I'm a software developer from Berlin, Germany. Currently I am working mostly with Xamarin.Forms, .NET Standard, SQLite and Azure Functions. In the past I have worked with WinForms, WPF, ASP.NET, WCF, MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL, Embedded Linux (C++), etc.

I am dedicated to high quality code and interested in all things architecture.
